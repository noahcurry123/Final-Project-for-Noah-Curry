Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I have planned out how I am going to be approaching this project and have been watching numerous videos that explain code that we have not gone over in class yet. I am taking this slower than I would like to but this project is something I'm passionate in and something that I am going to be using as a learning experience to push myself and my limits when it comes to coding.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

The only thing that I have not done for the project yet is start the actual framework, I have been saving and researching the best code that is going to be needed for my project but I have not actually started the coding portion yet. I have also not started the artwork portion yet but there is enough time for me to dabble around with it.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have not run into any problems but I am sure that I will during the coding process but I am going to do everything in my power to make a successful project. This is something that I am looking forward to do and using it as an experience for my future endeavors.
