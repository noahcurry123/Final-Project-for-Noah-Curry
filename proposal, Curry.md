# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TPT (Two-Player Tetris)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I have always wanted to create my own version of a video game and my goal for this project is to create a unique multiplayer version of tetris. Who ever gets the higher score will end up being victorious.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will integrate a multiplayer version of tetris on one computer device. The two players will take turns and see who can get the higher score. It will be executed in python and I am going to try my best to integrate my own art concepts into it as well.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

The part of 1051 that I will integrate is the multiplayer version of the game but I will actually have a game where the computer down not play.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A
## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish the game itself with a multiplayer option. The part that may be diffcult is integrating my own art but I will try my best to integrate it into the game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be having a complete multiplayer game with a rematch feature and my own art filled throughout the game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome is having a full, complete, designed game with every aspect being unique in it's own way. Maybe even add some sound to it as well.
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The biggest part of this project for me is researching how to integrate tetris into a multiplayer game on the same device. I also want to have a rematch feature in my game so I will have to teach myself through extra reseach as well. I am doing this project completely by myself and I am excited to do it for future usage and knowledge. And if this gets to a certain point, would love for it to possibly be on my resume in the future.
