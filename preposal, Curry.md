# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

My main idea that I want to do for my final project is create a video game like tetris or snake. I want the game to also possibly be a head to head game of some sort where two people face off against each other on the same device, they would just take turns.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I will be doing this project by myself. 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Nope, no questions.
