Walkthrough Video on YouTube (FALL 2021) - https://youtu.be/cxseyxwQtwI

Intro:

Although I did not accomplish my initial vision, I learned a lot about python while doing this final project. Not only did I learn more in depth topics about python, I learned that it was possible to create a video game with the turtle function that we learned this year. I have been coding since high school and have used multiple types of code to create a diverse amount of video games. The reason why I wanted to implement my own art for additional work was to see if I could teach myself how to do that but I wasn't able to. For this project I took inspiration from a YouTuber named TokyoEdTech through a three part tutorial on how and what to code for my project. The links will be provided below and I have to note that his code was a huge inspiration for mine.

What I Enjoyed:

The most intriguing part to me about this project was using turtle to make this game work. Almost every tutorial I came across used an outside source that we did not learn or use in class called "pygame". Something else that I enjoyed was that I learned that there are a diverse amount of ways that people can code differently but still end up with the same outcome. There are so many ways to implement code differently and I can't wait to continue this project in the future.

Problems I encountered:

The two biggest problems that I encountered was not being able to make the game end, and having the game come to a stop when the blocks touch the top of the screen. I tried to use "wn.exitonclick()" to allow the user to have a way to quickly end the game but I could not find a way for it to work yet. For the other problem, when the blocks touch the top of the screen the game doesn't end. I am not too sure where to start with this problem since I used turtle for this project, but if I had to take a guess, maybe implement a function using true and false options.
